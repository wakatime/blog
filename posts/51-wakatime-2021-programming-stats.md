Happy New Year! Here's your WakaTime code stats for 2021.

<img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/covers/fireworks.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="fireworks" style="width:90%" />

In 2021, more than 300k developers spent a combined 39 million hours programming, tracked with WakaTime text editor plugins.
The average person spent 48 minutes per day programming.
This post is an analysis of all those hours spent programming during 2021, and a quick list of improvements and new features.

## New Features & Milestones

### ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Leaderboard Flags
We added flags to the [leaderboard][leaderboard]. Click a flag to see the ranks of devs only in that country.

### ðŸ˜Ž Project Badges
We already had [repo badges][repo badges], now we also have [project badges][project badges]. The difference is you donâ€™t need to connect a repo to get a badge, but project badges only show your time coded instead of all repo contributors.
We also added support for customizing badge styles with `?style=` in the badge url.

### ðŸ’¾ Backups
We improved the [export feature][export] with a choice of two types of export: daily or raw. For backing up your code stats, select the raw export.

### ðŸ“Š Download Project Dashboards
You can now download a [project dashboard][projects] as csv or json.

### ðŸ§¾ Invoicing
[Join the waitlist][invoicing] to be one of the first to use our new invoicing tool!
