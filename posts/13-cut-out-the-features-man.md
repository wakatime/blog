So we finally got around to analyzing the results of our holiday survey.  In some ways, I feel good because our hypotheses of what users want seems to be on point.  But I also realize we have ways to go.  While we understand our users, we have to listen ever more intently to them in order to transform [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) from a time tracking app to the premier automated developer analytics tool.

What did we learn specifically?

**No one wants superfluous features.**

Our users are astute.  At our stage, extraneous features is the biggest trap Alan and I find ourselves facing.  There are so many things we could do.  But [the key is to not fall into this temptation](http://ethansaustin.com/2015/01/01/the-habit-of-no/) and keep on our path of providing the cleanest developer analytics.  Thanks for the gut check, guys.

**The dashboard and reports by project tied as the most important existing features.**

This is interesting insight for us.  Our expectation was the dashboard would win hands down.  Not the case.  We were working on a lot of cool ideas but nothing project specific.  We will now delve deeper into the project reports and give you better benefits and usability.

**Clear majority delighted us in the top requested new feature - Everyone wants commit-tracking!**

This one was reassuring.  We are on the same page that commit-tracking will be a game changer.  Give us a month or two ;-)

**And finally, the biggest human learning ... **

Everyone wanted to give themselves a present on Christmas! :-)

Since today is [Martin Luther King Jr. Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day) in the United States, I will end with a quote from him - "Everything begins with being good to each other, people."  So thank you for being so good to us, users.  We will work our hardest to delight you with awesome product benefits in 2015.
