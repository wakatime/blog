This week is <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2014/">EclipseCon 2014</a> in San Francisco, where <span class="tip" title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</span> enthusiests gather to talk Java.
It seems fitting to release the <a href="https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/eclipse">Eclipse plugin</a> for WakaTime this week.


For the freelancers at the conference, now you can easily track the time you spend programming:

All WakaTime [plugins](https://wakatime.com/plugins) work together. For example, you can switch between [Vim](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/vim), [Sublime Text](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/sublime), and now [Xcode](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/xcode) without losing your logged time.
If you use revision control, such as Git, you can work on the same projects with different editors and your time is logged correctly.
