Every week, residents of the <a href="https://twitter.com/pahackerhouse">Hacker House</a> gather around a backyard fire-pit while chatting about startups.
It was a mind meld of professional programmers, designers, and entrepreneurs.
On May 3rd 2013 at one of these backyard fire-pit events I came up with the idea for WakaTime.

Two residents, <a href="https://kirubakaran.com/">Kirubakaran</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rfadams">Robert</a>, were experienced consultants and accustomed to tracking their hours.
I was a salary-man new to contract programming.
Sometimes, I would forget to start my timer or log time to the wrong project.
The possibility for human error left a feeling of uncertainty lingering, not to mention it was a pain in the butt to start & stop a timer all the time.

"Why can't this be automatic?" I asked my fellow hackers as we sat around the fire that <span class="tip" title="May 3rd 2013">night</span>.
A plugin for my text-editor would know exactly how long I was programming and a web interface would make it easy to graph and visualize the logged time.
I could still manually track my time, but I would always have a source of truth in case I forgot to start or stop the timer.

The Swahili word <a href="http://translate.google.com/#sw/en/wakati">wakati</a> means time.
That same night I registered the domain <a href="http://wakati.me">wakati.me</a> and started building the automatic time tracker WakaTime.
