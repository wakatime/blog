[WakaTime][wakatime] is like fitbit for programmers, and we are always looking for new ways to visualize our data.
Our dashboard is great for seeing project, file, and branch level visualizations over various time ranges, but it can't create custom queries of your data.
You could use our [api][api], but we have an easier way...

### Introducing wakadump!

Using [wakadump][wakadump], you can easily export your WakaTime data to [Keen IO][keen io] and take advantage of their powerful data explorer features.
For example, I queried all my WakaTime data from the last year and was quickly able to create these custom visualizations:

### Most productive day of the week

### Top files worked in over the last year

### Editor usage over the last year

### Programming languages used over the last year

### Create your own visualizations

To create your own custom queries using the [Keen IO data explorer][keen io data explorer], just follow these steps:

1. Install [wakadump][wakadump] with:

    `sudo pip install wakadump`

2. Export your logged time from your [settings page][settings page].

3. Sign up for a free [Keen IO][keen io] account and grab your `Project ID` and `Write Key` from your project page.

4. Upload your WakaTime data to Keen IO by running this command:

    ```wakadump --input wakatime-user.json --output keen.io
    keen.io Project ID: XXXX
    keen.io project Write Key: XXXX
    Preparing keen.io events...
    Uploading events to keen.io...
    Complete.```

5. Create custom queries using Keen IO's [Data Explorer][keen io data explorer]
