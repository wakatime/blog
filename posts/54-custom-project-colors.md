Here at WakaTime we’re always looking for ways to improve the developer dashboards and UX.
That’s why we’ve added the ability to set custom colors for your projects.
Now, if you select green for `Project X`, all your WakaTime dashboards will show `Project X` in that same green color.
This consistent color coding will make it easier to organize and recognize your projects.

[Project colors][projects] support all HEX color codes, except for the reserved colors white and black.
That’s 16777214 colors to choose from for your projects!

To customize a project’s color, use the settings dropdown on the right side of the [projects list](projects) or on a project’s dashboard.

<div style="display:inline-block;width:100%;"><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/project-colors-dropdown.png" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-4" alt="project colors dropdown screenshot" /></div>

Now your WakaTime dashboards are more consistent, customizable, and colorful. ;)
Happy Coding!
