Weâ€™re excited to announce three new features released in 2019 Q4.

<br>

ðŸ“Š **Anonymous team dashboards** - turn this on and only project totals are displayed, individual developer times are hidden.
Enable anonymous team dashboards from your [dashboard settings][dashboards] page.

ðŸ“« **Share weekly summary report emails** - basically the Unix [tee][tee] command for your report emails.
Share report emails from your [notification settings][notifications] page.
