As our weekly newsletter takes a turn for the real, I thought it would be helpful to make the emails available in the blog.

-----

Hi there,

Inspired by [Biz Stone](http://omnipolis.com/applause-to-biz-stone-finally-someone-writes-a-good-company-newsletter/) , I realized our snazzy HTML emails were not true to who we are at WakaTime (https://wakatime.com) .  Every time a user reaches out, on twitter, via email or in person, we engage with them as people.  We like our community of developers.  It was time for the cookie-cutter “newsletter best practices” to go out the window.  So today I am changing things up from our old newsletter style.

It’s been a busy week for Alan and I.  I got the opportunity to speak on developer productivity at Developer Week in San Francisco.  We used our data to give out productivity awards and also discussed our opinion on what developer productivity is and what it should be.  [Here’s our presentation](https://wakatime.com/blog/17-whos-the-most-productive-of-us-all)  with info on how the data was collected.

Alan has been on fire this week.  He built a beta version of a [WakaTime Slack plugin](https://wakatime.com/slack) . Some of our friends running startups asked for it and we realized teams might find it very useful.  Currently, it works just like the GitHub Slack plugin, which sends a broadcast message every time you commit with the addition of the time spent on that commit.

As always, you guys overwhelm us with the awesome things you build on top of WakaTime and the time (hehe, no pun intended) you spend improving the product. One of our users, [Russell Osborne](https://wakatime.com/@rposborne) , is building an alternate git commit tracking for WakaTime and [wrote an article](http://burningpony.com/2015/02/that-feature-took-how-long/)  on his work.  He also talks about integrating the WakaTime numbers with Quickbooks for easier invoicing.  His git repo for the alternate commit tracking is [here](https://github.com/rposborne/gitwakatime) .

Anyway, it’s been real folks.  I enjoyed writing this email.  I hope you liked reading it.  Feel free to write back and let me know what you think of this change. Do you miss my meme pics? :-)

Until next week!
