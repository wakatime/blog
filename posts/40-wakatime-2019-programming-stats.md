Itâ€™s 2020, Happy New Year!

Hereâ€™s the aggregate 2019 programming stats for all WakaTime users, followed by your personalized 2019 stats.

## Programming stats for 2019

In 2019, WakaTime users programmed a combined **25,796,684 hrs**!

The top languages were
**JavaScript (5,036,909 hrs)**,
**PHP (2,695,295 hrs)**,
**TypeScript (2,114,010 hrs)**,
**Java (1,709,433 hrs)**,
**Python (1,407,783 hrs)**,
**Vue.js (1,142,832 hrs)**,
**HTML (1,090,992 hrs)**,
**C# (771,636 hrs)**,
**SCSS (543,318 hrs)**,
**JSON (541,879 hrs)**,
**Ruby (533,978 hrs)**,
**Kotlin (457,646 hrs)**,
**JSX (451,577 hrs)**,
and **Go (418,271 hrs)**.

In 2019, TypeScript overtook Java for 3rd place.
JavaScript + TypeScript still hold the lead when combined as theyâ€™re used three times more than any other language.
Weâ€™re personally happy to see Python holds 5th place again this year, since WakaTime heavily utilizes Python and Flask.

The top text editors were
**VS Code (12,059,899 hrs)**,
**PhpStorm (2,249,455 hrs)**,
**IntelliJ (1,863,507 hrs)**,
**Chrome (1,543,578 hrs)**,
**Android Studio (1,374,707 hrs)**,
**Sublime Text (1,265,485 hrs)**,
**WebStorm (1,093,567 hrs)**,
**Visual Studio (860,975 hrs)**,
**Vim (673,527 hrs)**,
**PyCharm (640,924 hrs)**,
**Atom (586,239 hrs)**,
**GoLand (173,913 hrs)**,
**Emacs (171,210 hrs)**,
**RubyMine (154,075 hrs)**,
**Eclipse (151,967 hrs)**,
**Rider (122,118 hrs)**,
**Xcode (121,435 hrs)**,
**NetBeans (87,572 hrs)**,
**CLion (60,860 hrs)**,
**Coda (53,563 hrs)**.
and **Sketch (48,775 hrs)**.

VS Code still holds 1st place this year, and the gap increased from 1st to 2nd since 2018.
Combine all Jetbrains IDEs and theyâ€™re only half the usage of VS Code.
Sublime Text usage decreased in 2019, dropping from 3rd to 6th place.
Atom really is dead... itâ€™s usage was cut in half in 2019, most likely as developers switched to VS Code.

The top operating systems used were
**Mac (12,641,894 hrs)**,
**Windows (8,429,597 hrs)**,
and **Linux (4,690,349 hrs)**.
