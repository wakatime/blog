Happy New Year!
In 2019, over 200k developers spent a combined 25 million hours programming, tracked with WakaTime text editor plugins!

The top languages were
**JavaScript (5,033,788 hrs)**,
**PHP (2,693,964 hrs)**,

In 2019, TypeScript overtook Java for 3rd place.
JavaScript + TypeScript still hold the lead when combined as theyâ€™re used three times more than any other language.
Weâ€™re personally happy to see Python holds 5th place again this year, since WakaTime heavily utilizes Python and Flask.

The top text editors were
**VS Code (12,052,975 hrs)**,
**PhpStorm (2,248,752 hrs)**,
**IntelliJ (1,862,740 hrs)**,
**Chrome (1,542,063 hrs)**,
**Android Studio (1,374,508 hrs)**,
**Sublime Text (1,265,235 hrs)**,
**WebStorm (1,091,786 hrs)**,
**Visual Studio (860,582 hrs)**,
**Vim (672,586 hrs)**,
**PyCharm (640,552 hrs)**,
**Atom (585,443 hrs)**,
**GoLand (173,790 hrs)**,
**Emacs (170,790 hrs)**,
**RubyMine (153,851 hrs)**,
**Eclipse (151,885 hrs)**,
**Rider (122,114 hrs)**,
**Xcode (121,435 hrs)**,
**NetBeans (87,572 hrs)**,

VS Code still holds 1st place this year, and the gap increased from 1st to 2nd since 2018.
Combine all Jetbrains IDEs and theyâ€™re only half the usage of VS Code.
Sublime Text usage decreased in 2019, dropping from 3rd to 6th place.
Atom really is dead... itâ€™s usage was cut in half in 2019, most likely as developers switched to VS Code.

The top operating systems used were
**Mac (12,633,319 hrs)**,
**Windows (8,424,908 hrs)**,
and **Linux (4,687,708 hrs)**.
