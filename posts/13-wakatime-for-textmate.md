I noticed a lot of votes requesting support for TextMate recently, so I built the [WakaTime plugin for TextMate](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/textmate).
The plugin took <a href="https://wakatime.com/@alan/projects/fisdvyodbu?start=2015-04-04&end=2015-04-10">10 hours and 40 minutes</a> to build in total.

You can use more than one WakaTime plugin at the same time, so be sure to check out all our [supported editors and IDEs](https://wakatime.com/plugins)!
