The latest version of WakaTime allow more control over what gets logged. You can now whitelist directories and prevent all other files from being logged.

All you need to do is paste this in your ~/.wakatime.cfg INI file:
exclude =
    .*
include =
    path/to/my/projects

What this does is prevent all files from being logged because .* matches everything. Then specifically include the directories you do want to log by listing them in the include array.

So if for some reason, you want to only track some files, this makes it easier.  More power for you!
