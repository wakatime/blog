We are excited to announce support for [Panic's Coda editor](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/coda)!
After installing the plugin inside Coda, your WakaTime dashboard will show metrics about your Coda usage.

All WakaTime [plugins](https://wakatime.com/plugins) work together, so you can use the Coda plugin at the same time as all other WakaTime plugins.

The plugin is open-source on GitHub at [https://github.com/wakatime/coda-wakatime](https://github.com/wakatime/coda-wakatime).

Here's the [Coda WakaTime Plugin](https://panic.com/coda/plugins.php?id=139) page on Panic's plugin list with a nice green Install button!
