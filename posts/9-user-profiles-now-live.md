Today we have released profile pages for every user on WakaTime. You can now personalize your URL and most interestingly, make your logged time &amp; top programming languages public.

We'll be hosting a language-based tournament soon, so go public and participate!

Here's a link to your profile page. <a href="https://wakatime.com/me">https://wakatime.com/me</a>
