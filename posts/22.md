I have mused before about events being a [waste of time](https://wakatime.com/blog/12-dont-go-to-events-as-a-startup-founder?page=2).  But then I went against my own advice and hosted booths, gave talks at quite a few startup and developer events.  Rather hypocritical, no?  No.  I recently realized that events hold a very different meaning for a startup versus a founder.  Launch 2015 in particular was something that completely belied my image of a well-planned, successful, worth-attending event, but was 100% useful for WakaTime.

Launch was one of the lesser organized events I have attended.  However, it did a kick ass job of putting us front and center of people who cared about our product.  We met current users who came and thanked us for our work.  Developers who hadn’t heard of us got excited when they saw our booth.  Investors stopped by to chit-chat and hang.  It was all kinds of cool.

One big thing we learned was that an event will magnify the response you currently get from your users, it will not change it.  Developers love our product.  That was what we observed at the event too.  A lot of team leads are intrigued by WakaTime’s potential and quiz us on our plans for groups.  The same happened at the event.  Similar to the off-event response, teams want more of us.  They ask us to utilize our data in new and unique ways before their wallets come out.  

Perhaps the coolest thing Launch did for us was give us street cred.  When I got into a Lyft yesterday, the driver said, “You guys were at Launch, right?  I saw your booth.  Kickass product, man.”  I’ve heard multiple references to our attendance at events like Launch.  In a world where thousands of companies compete fiercely for a 10 seconds of the users mindshare, that’s invaluable. 

Ultimately, an event can do wonders for your company if planned right.  As an individual, you should go to events that are well organized, selective in their attendees and help you achieve a very specific goal.  As a company, you should try to get into the biggest event for your industry possible and engage everyone who walks by.  Spray and pray.  After all, it takes one meeting to turn around your destiny and you don’t want to miss it.
