Today GitHub [announced][github blog] it will archive Atom and all projects under the Atom organization for an official sunset on December 15, 2022.

## Why?

Development on Atom [has][2020 stats] [been][2021 stats] [slowing][year end reports] for a while now.
We see the effects of that in unresolved bugs.
For example, [atom/atom#25426][atom bug] which prevents installing plugins including [WakaTime][wakatime].
The bottom line is other editors have become more popular and the void that Atom once filled has disappeared.

## Whatâ€™s next?

You can continue using Atom until December 15, 2022 and some things may still work, but consider switching as soon as possible to another [supported editor][editors].
We recommend [VS Code][vscode] since it will feel the most comfortable when making the transition from Atom.
