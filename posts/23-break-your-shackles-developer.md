We've done a lot of promotion around our [WakaTime-Slack integrations](https://wakatime.com/integrations).  Why, you'd wonder.  We are not even listed as an official Slack integration.  Yet. ;-)  It's because the integration completely changed our workflow at WakaTime.  And if there are teams out there we could help, we want to put all efforts into getting the word out there. 

For Alan and I, he has always done the heavy lifting engineering wise.  I focus mostly on front-end and you know, businessy stuff.  But we decide the product roadmap and plan together every week.  However, we are running a startup and things change often from external stimulus.  We noticed we were forced to play a lot of catch up every morning at stand up.  There was some technical fire to fight all the time which would derail us from the product goals.  We both had to dig up our WakaTime stats to see where our day had vanished - was it bugs, infrastructure stuff, or did we actually get around to growth. 

So we built the WakaTime integrations for [GitHub + Slack](https://wakatime.com/integrations) to make our lives easier.  Now we could suddenly see in real-time when a commit was made and how much time it cost.  Alan and I weren't even chained to our desks anymore.  He can now set up shop at his favorite, Philz Coffee, while I made myself comfortable at Venetia after our standups.  We check in as needed, sometimes working in the same space, sometimes not.  But it's always a choice. 

If you would like similar freedom and still work as part of a team, here's how you set up our magic integration :-)

1.  Sign up for [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) and install the plugin for your text editor/IDE.  Duh!

2.  Go to the [WakaTime dashboard](https://wakatime.com/dashboard) and integrate with GitHub for the projects you want to broadcast commits from.

3.  Now the final step.  Set up the [Slack integration](https://wakatime.com/integrations/slack).

</div>

You're all set!  You will receive your first broadcast as soon as you make a commit.  Once your team-mates follow the same instructions, you all will be ready to enjoy a free life!
