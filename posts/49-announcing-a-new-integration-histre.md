[Histre][histre] is a collaborative bookmarking tool for researching, annotating, and enhancing websites.
When you enable the [Histre integration][integration], the time you spend browsing websites is synced to your WakaTime dashboard.

Here are some features of Histre to improve your productivity:


### [Take notes on any website][annotations]

Have you ever bookmarked a website, only to have it get lost in the sea of bookmarks?
Bookmarking with notes fixes this.
For example, when I’m planning my next vacation destination, I take tons of notes about each location.
Histre saves these notes along with the website, and makes them searchable so I can easily find bookmarks for a particular destination or topic.


### [Highlight text on any website][highlights]

Similar to notes, highlights are a way to bookmark websites while saving the important context of the page.
As I read through docs and articles, I use Histre to highlight the important parts.
Highlights are searchable, and make sharing sections of websites easy.

### [Save and Restore Tabs][tabs]

If you’re like me and you keep tons of browser tabs open, you can easily save all your window’s tabs with Histre.
Restore the tabs anytime, even on a different machine or a different browser.


### [Hacker News integration][hn feature]

Histre “enhances” the [Hacker News website][hn] to show upvotes of people you follow.
[Alan][alan], the founder of WakaTime, says this is his favorite feature of Histre.
Check out [Alan’s upvoted HN stories][alan upvotes], and click “Follow” to see his upvotes inline when you visit the [Hacker News website][hn].

I hope you find the [WakaTime + Histre integration][integration] useful, and to find out more about Histre features visit [histre.com][histre].
