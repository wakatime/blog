Humans can't take millions of events and output a pretty chart. Only software
can, and that's why we engineers like building data analytics products.
The classic data business model goes like:

1. collect data
2. analyze the data
3. visualize the data in meaningful ways
4. become a platform for querying the data

However, startups often build a *nice to have* product instead of the
*I can't do my job without this* product. Why should I pay for
[Heap](https://heapanalytics.com), [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), or
[Chartio](https://chartio.com/) when I could just use
[Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/),
[Piwik](http://piwik.org/), or [C3](http://c3js.org/) for free?

### That one killer feature

When I first started using [Heap](https://heapanalytics.com) it had a nice UI,
was easy to setup, and I liked it tracking everything retroactively.
While nice to have, these features didn't convert me to a paid customer and I
continued using Heap on the free plan.

### November 13th, 2014 Heap releases new retention table

<a href="https://heapanalytics.com/features/retention" target="_blank"><img src="https://heapanalytics.com/img/feature_retention1.png" class="img-thumbnail" style="width:70%;" alt="user engagement rates by weekly cohort" /></a>

Now I can see my active user metrics in ways that were near impossible before.
This one feature is the basis of [whole products](https://usercycle.com/), and Heap generates it for me automatically!
This killer feature is why I'm now on Heap's Growth plan at $249/month.

[My own data analytics product](https://wakatime.com/) is very similar.
WakaTime solves a core problem for contractors and freelancers, automated time tracking.
Still, the general dev audience sees WakaTime as a *nice to have* with graphs
about their coding but not an integral part of their workflow.

### The killer feature for WakaTime

Imagine your team lead asks how long a new feature will take you to build...
You type that feature into a search box, then an estimate is given of 6 hours.

Since WakaTime knows how long each feature takes to complete, it's now possible
to estimate how many hours of real coding time a feature should take to finish.
This means the team lead or PM can story point tasks in the backlog without asking
a developer.

### Non-devs can estimate how long features will take!

My hope is to also find a *killer feature* using all this data about coding time.
Maybe this is the one... we will see after I test it. What's your opinion?
