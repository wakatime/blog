Here at WakaTime we love hearing from our users, especially when it’s to request a new WakaTime feature.
One of the most frequently requested features is the ability to share coding goals.
So, today we’re launching the ability to share personal goals with other WakaTime users.

When you share a goal, it will show up on the other person’s [Goals Page][goals page].
Sharing your coding goals keeps you accountable and motivated to accomplish your goals!
