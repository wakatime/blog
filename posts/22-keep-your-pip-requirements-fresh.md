<hr />

**Update 2020:** The new way to manage your Python dependencies is [Pipenv][pipenv].
It’s like Yarn for Python with updating, locking, and combined with [pyenv][pyenv] even manages your project’s Python version.
For an example Pipenv setup check out the [wakatime-cli GitHub repository][wakatime-cli].

<hr />

You've probably seen that `requirements.txt` file in the root of your favorite Python repo listing high-level dependencies.

    flask==0.9
    sqlalchemy==0.9.10
    alembic==0.8.4

Fixing dependencies to a specific version is best practice, but keeping your dependencies up-to-date is a PITA.

### Past Workflows

The [Kenneth Reitz workflow][kenneth-reitz-workflow] needs no extra tools, but requires two requirements.txt files, one high-level list without versions specified and a second full list with fixed versions:
`pip install -r requirements-to-freeze.txt --upgrade && pip freeze > requirements.txt`

This is probably the best workflow, if you don't mind having to install the packages to upgrade your `requirements.txt` file.

However, sometimes you need special flags or setup before installing your packages, especially if the package includes non-Python code.
How can you update your `requirements.txt` without actually changing your installed packages?
You could use [pip-compile][pip-tools] to search for updates.
I don't like `pip-compile` because the generated `requirements.txt` file includes all sub-dependencies and the original formatting is lost.

### Using Pur

This is why we now have [pur][pur].

<a href="https://github.com/alanhamlett/pip-update-requirements"><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/blog/pur.gif" class="img-responsive" /></a>

Give pur your `requirements.txt` file and it updates your high-level packages to the latest versions, keeping your original formatting and comments in-place.

For example, running pur on the example `requirements.txt` above updates the packages to the currently available latest versions:

    $ pur -r requirements.txt
    Updated flask: 0.9 -> 0.10.1
    Updated sqlalchemy: 0.9.10 -> 1.0.12
    Updated alembic: 0.8.4 -> 0.8.6
    All requirements up-to-date.

Because pur never modifies your environment or installed packages, it's extremely fast and you can safely run it without fear of corrupting your local virtual environment.
Pur separates updating your `requirements.txt` file from installing the updates.
So you can use pur, then install the updates in separate steps.

Use [pur][pur] today and keep your dependencies fresh!
