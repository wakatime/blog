Do you know which day of the week you code the most?
How about how many hours you code per day on average?
How does your coding activity look over the last year?

These are the types of questions weâ€™re answering on the new [insights page][insights] released today.

Pro tip: Add the url param [color=green][insights green] to use the same colors as your GitHub profile activity chart.

Happy Coding!
