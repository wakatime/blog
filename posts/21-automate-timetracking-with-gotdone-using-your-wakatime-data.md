*This is a guest post by [Timm Stokke](https://wakatime.com/@t1mmen) from [GotDone][gotdone].*

WakaTime is awesome. I love that I don’t have to worry about starting and stopping timers to measure how long I spent programming.
Since WakaTime automatically keeps track for me, I get to stay in the zone instead of managing timers.

Did you know that inefficient time and work tracking practices cost the average company $50,000 per employee per year?
Sounds crazy, but [it’s true][timesheets cost]!

WakaTime helps solve this problem for programming activities, but what about everything else?
The emails you send, tasks you complete, meetings you attend and the gazillion other small things going on every day.
Are we all stuck running timers and keeping meticulous notes?

[There is a better way!][integration]

[GotDone][gotdone] works much like WakaTime, only for your entire workday.
Basically, GotDone connects your existing tools and services to automatically keep track of the code you write, emails you send, meetings you attend, tasks you complete, and so on.

At the end of the day (or week, or month), everything you’ve accomplished is laid out in a timeline – including activity tracked by WakaTime, Basecamp, Trello, Google Apps, Sprint.ly, Evernote and many, many others.

First-class integrations with leading time trackers such as Harvest, Toggl, Freckle, and others makes it super easy to record time based on what you actually worked on.
No more guesstimates!

In the end, that means you waste less time on tedious chores, more time in the zone and it earns your company more money.
