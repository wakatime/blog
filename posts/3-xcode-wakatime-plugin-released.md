For all you iOS and OSX devs, we have some exciting news for you: [WakaTime for Xcode](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/xcode) is ready!

<a href="https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/xcode"><img src="https://wakatime.com/static/img/editor-icons/xcode-128.png" /></a>

All WakaTime [plugins](https://wakatime.com/plugins) work together. For example, you can switch between [Vim](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/vim), [Sublime Text](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/sublime), and now [Xcode](https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/xcode) without losing your logged time.
If you use revision control, such as Git, you can work on the same projects with different editors and your time is logged correctly.
