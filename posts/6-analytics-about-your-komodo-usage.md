Do you use <a href="http://komodoide.com/komodo-edit/" target="_blank">Komodo Edit</a>, the cross-platform multi-language editor based off the Mozilla framework? How about the fully-featured <a href="http://komodoide.com/" target="_blank">Komodo IDE</a>? Now you can get analytics about your programming just by installing the open-source <a href="https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/komodo">WakaTime plugin</a> in your Komodo editor.

WakaTime runs in the background automatically logging the time you spend in Komodo each day. After programming for a while, the website shows how long you spent in each project and which programming languages you were using.

To install the <a href="https://wakatime.com/help/plugins/komodo">Komodo WakaTime plugin</a>, navigate to <code>Tools</code> â†’ <code>Add-ons</code> inside your Komodo editor then search for <code>WakaTime</code>.
