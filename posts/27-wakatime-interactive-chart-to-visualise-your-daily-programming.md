The latest addition to the [WakaTime Dashboard][dashboard] shows the time you were coding with detailed accuracy.
Since WakaTime measures your coding activity by combining the frequency of [heartbeats][heartbeats] into durations, this new chart lets you interactively visualize your day’s coding activity with different heartbeat timeout preferences.

Moving the slider to the left uses a shorter timeout, for a more accurate and granular representation of your programming.

This works in the opposite direction too:
To see when you started/stopped programming including the time you spent outside your text editor, move the slider to the right for a less granular picture of your programming activity.
When you spend a good portion of your day outside your text editor, increasing your timeout preference is a good way to measure your productive time spent outside your editor.

P.S. For those of you who have been around since the beginning, you might remember a similar version of this chart from the very first version of WakaTime in 2013!
