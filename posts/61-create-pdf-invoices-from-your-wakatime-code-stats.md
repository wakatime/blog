As a freelancer, I’ve spent years juggling multiple projects, filling out invoices, and trying to keep track of how much time I spend on each task.
This often resulted in me forgetting some billable hours, causing frustration and affecting my income.
Today I’m pleased to announce a solution: WakaTime Invoicing.

<div style="position:relative;margin-top:30px;margin-bottom:30px;padding-bottom:57.23370429252782%;height:0;"><iframe src="https://www.loom.com/embed/f4203c3370214fcabd9b217a9cb1ecb5" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>

[WakaTime Invoicing][invoicing] utilizes your WakaTime code stats to detect the projects you’ve worked on, and the amount of time you’ve spent on each project.
It then generates your invoice automatically, with the hours you worked on each project.
This means you can simply focus on your work and let WakaTime keep track of how long you worked.
When it’s time to bill your clients, WakaTime generates your pdf invoice and you can be confident that you won’t miss any billable hours.

I highly recommend WakaTime Invoicing to anyone who wants to streamline their invoicing process.
Give it a try, and let us know what you think!
