In 2024, more than 500k developers spent a combined 59 million hours programming, tracked with [WakaTime plugins][plugins].
The average person spent 51 minutes per day programming, a slight increase from [last year][last year blog].

Each year we release a [personalized coding report][report] showing your accomplishments over the last year.
This year I was excited find out my personal top language changed from `Python` to `TypeScript`, because my new project [wonderful.dev][wonderful.dev] uses the T3 stack [Next.js][nextjs], [Drizzle ORM][drizzle], [tRPC][trpc], [TailwindCSS][tailwindcss], and TypeScript.

We also include average trends for all WakaTime devs showing the most used languages, IDEs, and operating systems.
These trends come from aggregating the WakaTime personal dashboard metrics when a developer installs one of our [IDE plugins][plugins].
We can find new trends among software engineers using this data, for example this year a [new AI-powered editor][editors section] is gaining momentum: `Cursor`.
Thereâ€™s more exciting data belowâ€¦ but first, a quick list of new features released in 2024.

## New Features & Milestones

### [ðŸš€ Weâ€™re launching wonderful.dev!][wonderful.dev]
Claim your dev profile at [wonderful.dev/yourname][wonderful.dev] and connect with interesting companies.

### [ðŸ’» Windows Desktop App][win]
Weâ€™ve released a native Windows app that tracks your time in any app.
The Windows app lives in your system tray, and works by tracking the focused window title.
Itâ€™s perfect for filling in the gaps in your activity when not using a [supported IDE][plugins].

### [ðŸ•‘ Manually Add Time][manual]
Ever wanted to add some missing time to your dashboard?
Now you can manually add tracked time from your projectâ€™s dashboard.

## Programming stats for 2024

This year we surveyed our users asking for job descriptions, so youâ€™ll notice extra charts showing the breakdown of top languages, editors, and operating systems by job titles.
