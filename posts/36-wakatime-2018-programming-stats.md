### Organizations

We redesigned team dashboards to match actual company structures.
With <a href="https://wakatime.com/orgs">organizations</a> each team has their own dashboard.
Members of the dashboard see each otherâ€™s projects, languages, and other coding stats.
Organizations also get detailed audit logs, fine-grained permissions, and the ability to have multiple billing managers.

### Shareable and inverseable goals

<a href="https://wakatime.com/goals">Personal goals</a> are now shareable with other users.
Using the goal settings menu, enter a WakaTime username or email to send invitations for viewing your goals.
Also, goals can now be inversed. For example, a goal to code *less* time on weekends.

### Tracking compile times

Your WakaTime dashboard now shows your time spent coding vs time spent waiting for <a href="https://wakatime.com/blog/30-tracking-build-times-in-xcode">builds to compile</a>.
Available now for Xcode and coming to other IDEs in the future.
