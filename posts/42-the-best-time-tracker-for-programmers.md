If you’re an independent contractor writing software, then this post is for you.

Even if you do project-based invoicing, accurate time tracking is important for measuring the effort you’re devoting to each client and in return how much you should be charging for your time.

Time trackers can be grouped into manual and automated categories:

## Manual time trackers

### [Toggl][toggl] - A simple time tracker with stopwatch app for many platforms

Use this if you’re not a software engineer.
Its simplicity and support for multiple platforms has made it the leader in general time tracking.

### [FreshBooks][freshbooks] - An invoicing platform, with a time tracking feature

Use this if you have a lot of clients where sending invoices and collecting payments is taking up a lot of your time.

## Automated time trackers

### [Upwork][upwork] - A freelancer platform with a creepy screenshot desktop app

If you’re just starting out and need to find work, Upwork can be a good place to find new clients.
You get what you put into this one, and be prepared for some bad experiences along the way.

### [WakaTime][wakatime] - A time tracker for software engineers, with open source IDE plugins

WakaTime is a dashboard for developers, using IDE plugins to automate time tracking.
Use this if time tracking is an inconvenience and distracts from your high-paid projects.
Just make sure to increase the default [Timeout preference][timeout] so you’re not under-reporting your actual work time.

## The Winner?

Each one is a leader in their space so they’re naturally best for the specific use that they were targeting.
Nothing keeps you from using these time trackers together at the same time.
If you’re a programmer, keep [WakaTime][wakatime] running in the background so you never forget to start your manual timer.
If you’re looking for new clients, use Upwork.
If you just need simple time tracking, use Freshbooks or Toggl.
