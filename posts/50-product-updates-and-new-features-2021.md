<br>

ðŸ’ª **Plugin core rewritten in Go** - Our amazing team has finished porting wakatime-cli, used by all Waka plugins, from Python into Go. This removes edge-case issues related to system Python dependencies, and improves performance of the plugins. Check out the [shiny new GitHub repo][wakatime-cli]!

<br>

ðŸ”— **Integrations** - Several new [integrations][integrations] including Histre, Google Calendar, Zoom, and IFTTT.

Look forward to more features in the future. Stay safe and happy coding!
