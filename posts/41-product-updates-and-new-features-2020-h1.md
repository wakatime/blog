Hello everyone, with COVID-19 we’re switching from quarterly to semiannual updates. Here are the new features we’ve been working hard to release.

<br>

🐦 **Auto-Tweet your daily coding goals** - To stay accountable, for example: when doing the [#100DaysOfCode][100daysofcode] challenge. Set your coding goal [here][goals].
